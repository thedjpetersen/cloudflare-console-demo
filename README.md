# Cloudflare API Token System Demo

A TypeScript implementation of Cloudflare's API token management system, demonstrating enterprise-grade security patterns and user interface design for cloud service access control.

## Overview

This project showcases a comprehensive API token management system, mirroring Cloudflare's approach to granular access control. Built with TypeScript and React, it serves as a reference implementation for building secure, scalable token management systems.

## Token System Architecture

The token system implements granular access control with type-safe permissions and an intuitive user interface. Built on TypeScript, it provides a robust foundation for managing programmatic access to cloud resources.

### Token Creation Workflow

Token creation follows a carefully designed two-step process:

1. **Template Selection**

   - Pre-configured templates for common use cases
   - Custom token creation option
   - Clear template descriptions and use cases

2. **Token Configuration**
   - Intuitive permission selection interface
   - Resource scope definition
   - Token naming and metadata management

### Permission Management

At the core of the system is a sophisticated permission management engine. It implements:

• Policy Types

- Allow/Deny mechanisms
- Resource-specific controls
- Scope-based permissions

• Permission Scopes

- Account-level access
- Zone-level permissions
- Service-specific controls

The system supports over 200 unique permission groups, each carefully defined to provide granular access control across different service areas.

### Pre-built Templates

The template system includes several categories of pre-configured access patterns:

• DNS Management

- Record modification permissions
- Zone setting controls
- DNS-specific resource scopes

• Security Controls

- WAF configuration access
- Rate limiting management
- SSL/TLS settings

• Account Operations

- Billing information access
- Analytics data retrieval
- User management controls

### Implementation Details

The token system's implementation is structured around several key components:

```typescript
// Core type definitions
type Policy = {
  effect: "allow" | "deny";
  resources: { [key: string]: string };
  permission_groups: Array<{ id: string; name: string }>;
};
```

The system is built using:

- React components for the user interface
- TypeScript for type safety
- Custom hooks for state management
- Modular architecture for maintainability

## Development

To get started with development:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## ESLint Configuration

The project maintains high code quality standards through ESLint with TypeScript integration. The configuration can be extended by updating the `parserOptions` in your ESLint config, installing additional plugins as needed, and configuring React-specific rules. For detailed ESLint setup, refer to the [ESLint documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started).
